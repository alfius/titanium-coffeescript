titanium-coffeescript
=====================

Overview
--------

This is an example project that demonstrates how to use Coffeescript (http://coffeescript.org) to build Titanium (http://appcelerator.com) applications for Android/iOS. It can be used as a template to create new applications.

Requirements
------------
* Titanium studio
* Android/iOS SDK
* Coffeescript compiler (http://coffeescript.org)
* Rake (make for ruby)

Usage
-----
All the new code should be written in coffeescript and saved to the "coffee" folder. Then, when running the "rake" command, all the coffeescript sources are compiled into javascript and saved to the "Resources" folder.
You can check the view at coffee/views/start.coffee for a brief example on how to create a window with Titanium.
